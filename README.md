ðŸŽ¾ TennisML


TennisML is my second project focused on the advanced analysis of tennis players' movements, sports performance, ball drop-off areas, and related statistical insights for data science applications.

To enhance the accuracy and depth of analysis, this project includes:

--- Extraction of white pixels to emphasize tennis-relevant features.


--- Manual configuration of court dots and lines for spatial consistency.


--- Use of Roboflow to segment the tennis ballâ€”starting by artificially increasing the ball size for better detection.


--- Preprocessing and editing of the input video to focus entirely on court scenes, excluding unrelated frames.



This project combines computer vision, object tracking, and performance analytics to explore and visualize tennis matches in a data-driven manner.
