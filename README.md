# TennisML

This is my second Machine Learning Project to develop the Tennis Analysis Software of pleayer's ratings, sports performance, movement, play styles, etc, most of the code are created from using AI (ChatGPT & Claude 4.0)

To increase the quality of GUI Function

To increase the accuracy of illustration, Matplotlib was used, Counting configurations of the ball drop-off were (Still developing with increasing court lines' accuracy) 


(Increasing accuracy by increasing size of segmentation of yellow Tennis Ball)

To increase the accuracy of ball detection, I have extracted white pixels of the court to detect the court lines' feature into 10 dots & several lines of the Tennis Court)

RoboFlow would be used for the segmentation
